# ReaWwind

ReaWwind is a collection of Reaper scripts meant to re-import audio from Wwise to Reaper, essentially the opposite of Audiokinetic's own ReaWwise plugin. 

## Purpose

The idea is to facilitate reusing game audio assets: use gameplay audio assets in a linear project (cutscene, trailer...) without having to dig for the original design session, or maybe in-Reaper sequencing of audio events to be later exported as markers in a game engine animation, etc.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

ReaWwind needs Audiokinetic's ReaWwise plugin installed.

### Installing

* Download from here 
* Load the following scripts in Reaper as new actions
  * ReaWwind_CreateNewItemsFromWwiseSelection.lua
  * ReaWwind_FillSelectedItemFromWwiseSelection.lua
  * ReaWwind_FillSelectedItemsFromItemNames.lua
